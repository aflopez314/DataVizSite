    <p id = 'a5p'>This table shows the ownership types for housing units in East Central Harlem by year. The bolder the variable of ownership type, the more housing units that are assigned to that category. The graph indicates that the most of the housing is under P and Null, which suggests large Private Ownership in East Central Harlem.

        <li>P: Private Ownership</li>
        <li>C: City Ownership</li>
        <li>O: Other - Public Authority, State, or Federal Ownership</li>
        <li>M: Mixed City and Private Ownership</li>
